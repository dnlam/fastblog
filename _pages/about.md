Hi there,
I am Lam DINH [Personal Web Page](https://dnlam.github.io), I graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology  (Vietnam) in 2016 with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. My training mainly focused on several areas: Digital Signal Processing, Wireless Communication and Embedded Programming. Then, I continued my study with a special interest in Signal Theory, Wireless Telecommunications and Optical Networks at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) in 2017.   

My Master's degree is jointly awarded by the École Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay (France) and the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) in 2019. The courses are related to the application of molecular photonics to telecommunications and biosensors.

From 2019, I am conducting a PhD thesis at the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA) in Grenoble. My research addresses ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) in 5G systems and beyond.
